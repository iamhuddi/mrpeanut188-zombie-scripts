The P345, released in 2004, is a semi-automatic pistol from Ruger Firearms. It is chambered in .45 and holds 8 rounds and 5 spare magazines.
Moderately heavy damage with high accuracy but a high-recoil kick.

Stag Arm's AR-15 semi-automatic rifle gives you 30 deadly shots of 5.56mm. Due to their size, you can only hold 4 extra magazines.

It's time to go hunting with a classic: the Lee-Enfield. Load 5 rounds of .303 British into the rifle, and watch their heads pop
one by one. As if that wasn't enough, pulling the bolt back makes you look like a badass. I'm sure you could fit quite a bit of
spare bullets in a pocket or a bag.

Size doesn't matter: This snub-nozed revolver is used among criminals in Brazil. They probably don't use a speed-loader, so why should
you either? You'll look more badass trying to shove some of spare ammo into the cylinder-- or die trying. You could probably carry a 
lot of ammo for this, but if you got a speed-loader, you could probably carry even more.
