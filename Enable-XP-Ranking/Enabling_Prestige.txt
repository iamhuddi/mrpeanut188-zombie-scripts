How to enable prestige:

Open MAPNAME/mp/ranktable.csv with a good text editor.
At the bottom, change the 0 after maxprestige to a 10.

In _challenges_coop.gsc settings section, change the prestige option to true instead of false.

//TODO: ADD A PRESTIGE BUTTON

To actually allow for prestige, you'll need to add a button yourself. The tutorial isn't done for this 
so you can either leave it disabled or just wait until this tutorial is finished to actually ALLOW
for prestige.
